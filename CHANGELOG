# Changes to dist/gvector.js, not reporting changes of documentation or demos

## 1.1.0

Assign proper content type for encoded images. Was hard-coded to image/gif.
New Arc2Earth layer (gvector.A2E) extends AGS uses Arc2Earth sync as back-end. Near real-time feature updates.
Documenting esriOptions parameter for gvector.AGS and gvector.A2E
Fixing bug where dynamic layers with the singleInfoWindow parameter set to true, any feature property update triggers a content change on the open InfoWindow, even if that feature hasn't changed

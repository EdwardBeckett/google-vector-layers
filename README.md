# Update

I've emptied out ths README as all of these docs are out of date and incorrect as I've been making lots of improvements recently. Stay tuned for a blog post over at http://geojason.info or see what I've got for docs/demos now at http://geojason.info/google-vector-layers/

This library will add Google Maps vector (Point, Polyline, Polygon) layers from multiple geo web services including ArcGIS Server, GeoIQ, Arc2Earth, etc.
